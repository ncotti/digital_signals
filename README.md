    "Wireless Communication Systems in Matlab, Viswanathan"

The following topics are covered:

* Channel capacity.
* Modulation types (PAM, QAM, PSK, OFDM).
* Pulse shaping.
* Oversampling and undersampling.
* Zero forcing equalizer (ZF-equalizer).
* Noise aggregation from generic channels (Gaussian, Rayleigh, Ricean).
* Receiver and transmitter impairments and compensations.
